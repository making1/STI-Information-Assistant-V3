# STI Information Assistant — GitHub/Streamlit Ready
Bilingual English/Kiswahili educational/research prototype. It is not a diagnostic or prescribing system.

## Deploy
Upload this folder's contents to the root of a GitHub repository. In Streamlit Community Cloud create an app from the repository, choose `main`, and set the entrypoint to `app.py`.

In Streamlit App Settings > Secrets add:
```toml
ADMIN_USERNAME = "your-admin-name"
ADMIN_PASSWORD = "your-long-unique-password"
```
Do not commit real credentials. `.gitignore` excludes `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and `sti_app.db`.

## Local run
Set `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` as environment variables, then:
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m streamlit run app.py
```

## Content governance
All seeded content is `pending_review`; only explicitly approved content is learner-visible. The application does not manufacture expert approval. A qualified Kenyan STI clinician/public-health reviewer and Kiswahili health-communication reviewer should approve content before real deployment.

## Important persistence note
This prototype uses SQLite. Hosted Streamlit local storage is not durable production storage; approvals, audit records, and inquiries may be lost on rebuild/replacement. For a real pilot/production system requiring persistent records, migrate the SQLAlchemy connection to a managed persistent database and complete security/privacy review.

The bundled TF-IDF + Logistic Regression model and tiny bilingual training dataset demonstrate the NLP pipeline; their evaluation is not research-grade validation.


## Changing the deployed admin login
`ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in Streamlit App Settings > Secrets are authoritative. After changing either value, save the Secrets and reboot/redeploy the app. On startup, the application synchronizes the admin account automatically; no manual database editing is required.

## V3 aggregate demographic reporting
The learner interface can collect, with separate explicit consent, gender, age bracket (18–19, 20–22, 23–25), sexual activity status, residence at county/town level, and nearest health facility. The Admin → Aggregate reporting tab displays grouped counts only. Users can choose “Prefer not to say” for sensitive fields. Residence guidance explicitly discourages home addresses. Demographic records are covered by the retention cleanup.

This reporting feature is for research/educational analytics, not diagnosis or clinical decision-making.
